My methodological research focuses on

1. semiparametric theory and methods for complex time-to-event data,  
1. subgroup identification/inference and individualized treatment effect estimation in precision medicine and public health,  
1. multi-omics data analysis and integration, and (4) deep learning and causal inference.  

My collaborative research has a broad scope. I first established my collaboration in cancer studies. Later, I have been actively working on neuropsychiatric disorders and aging-related research (e.g., Age-related macular degeneration and Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD)) using large-scale genetic and multi-omics data. Currently, I am also working on pediatric pulmonary diseases such as childhood asthma.
